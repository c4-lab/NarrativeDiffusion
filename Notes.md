Recall our original definition of story item adoption:  we define a story (S) as a set of items {s_i} connected as an undirected network, where links capture causal influence.   We will further define S_t \subseteq S as the set of items an agent has adopted at time t.  Finally, we define a likelihood function W that a person will adopt a new (unseen) s_i as:

$$W(s_i) = \frac{1}{|S_t|} \sum_{s_j \in S_t} \frac{1}{d(s_i, s_j) + 1}$$

<h1 style="color:red">ChatGPT</h1>

Your definition captures a probabilistic measure $W(s_i)$ that describes the likelihood of an agent adopting a new story item $s_i$ given a set $S_t$ of story items that the agent has already adopted at a given time $t$. The function depends on the average similarity (or alternatively, distance $d(s_i, s_j)$) between the new item $s_i$ and the items $s_j$ in $S_t$.

The definition of $W(s_i)$ encapsulates a number of interesting elements:

1. **Normalizing by $|S_t|$**: The division by the size of the set $S_t$ serves to normalize the function, ensuring that the likelihood does not unfairly inflate as an agent adopts more items. This reflects the intuition that the more items one has already adopted, the more "diluted" the influence of any single pre-adopted item would be on the adoption of a new one.

2. **Inverse Distance Measure**: The term $\frac{1}{d(s_i, s_j) + 1}$ serves as an inverse distance metric. This could capture the idea that the closer a new story item is to the items already adopted, the more likely it is to be adopted. The addition of 1 in the denominator ensures that the term doesn't become undefined or disproportionately large if $d(s_i, s_j)$ is small.

3. **Undirected Network**: By considering $S$ as an undirected network, your model assumes that causal influence between story items is bidirectional. This could reflect a nuanced understanding that items in a story often mutually inform and influence each other, rather than having a strict, one-way causal relationship.

### Potential Research Questions and Implications

1. **Thresholds for Adoption**: What is the minimum $W(s_i)$ needed for a reasonable chance of adoption? 
   
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: How does $W(s_i)$ change over time? Does it tend to increase or decrease as more items are adopted?

3. **Coherence and Adoption**: How might the "coherence" of the story, however defined, affect $d(s_i, s_j)$ and subsequently $W(s_i)$?

4. **External Influences**: What external factors might add noise to $W(s_i)$, like sudden viral events, introduction of new mediums or platforms, etc.?

5. **Individual Differences**: How might individual traits, like openness to new experiences or skepticism, alter $W(s_i)$?

6. **Network Topology**: How does the structure of $S$ itself affect $W$? For instance, are more densely interconnected story networks more likely to have their items adopted?

7. **Practical Applications**: This model could be used for predicting the spread of information, stories, or ideas in social networks, in content recommendation algorithms, or even in studying the spread of misinformation.

8. **Relation to Existing Models**: This might be related to or inspired by existing network diffusion models, like the Independent Cascade Model or the Linear Threshold Model. However, your definition also brings a unique element by introducing a personalized and dynamic measure $W(s_i)$.

The definition offers a formal way to approach the complex dynamics of story or information adoption within a network, laying the groundwork for both theoretical and empirical investigations.

Right - sorry, I hit enter before I had finished.  Just to make sure we're clear, d(s_i,s_j) is the shortest path between s_i and s_j in the causal network, ok?  Given this definition, we can calculate the probability of any given sequence of adoptions (of |S|! possible adoption sequences, presuming one adoption at a time).  This will effectively yield a probability distribution for adopting a story in its entirety. 

What I'd like to do now is see if we can solve to obtain a function that obtains this distribution for a specific class of stories as |S| \rightarrow \inf.  The class of stories I want to consider is linear stories - that is s_i connects to s_(i+1) for the entire length of the story.  Although not entirely realistic, this type of story is well behaved and should be analytically tractable.  I have simulated this and plotted a histogram, arriving at something that looks a bit like a log normal distribution, but analysis suggests that it doesn't really match any known distributions.  Could you help me to figure out how to calculate this?  I imagine it's some kind of series expansion, but could be wrong.  We might start with layout out equations for stories of length 1, 2, 3, etc.

One thing I'm uncertain of is how to calculate the shape of the distribution - it seems straightforward to  calculate the probability of any given path, but I don't really know how to do this over all paths.  Can you help?

<h1 style="color:red">ChatGPT</h1>

The problem you're describing is quite interesting: you're aiming to find the probability distribution for the adoption of a linear story (i.e., $s_1 \rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow s_n$) as the length of the story $|S|$ approaches infinity. Your specified likelihood function $W(s_i)$ quantifies how likely an individual is to adopt each $s_i$ based on previously adopted story elements, and $d(s_i, s_j)$ is the shortest path between $s_i$ and $s_j$ in the causal network.

Given that the network is linear, the distance $d(s_i, s_j)$ is simply $|i-j|$.

### Steps to Lay Out Equations for Short Stories:

Let's look at some examples to understand the mechanism for short stories:

- **Story of length 1:**  
  - There's only one item $s_1$. In this case, $W(s_1)$ is simply some initial probability $P_{\text{init}}$ (could be 1 for simplification) of adopting $s_1$.

- **Story of length 2:**  
  - If $s_1$ is already adopted, $W(s_2) = \frac{1}{1} \left( \frac{1}{1+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$ 
  - If $s_2$ is already adopted, $W(s_1) = \frac{1}{2}$ too. 
  - Here we have different sequences ($s_1 \rightarrow s_2$ or $s_2 \rightarrow s_1$) with corresponding probabilities.

- **Story of length 3:**  
  - This will be more complicated. If $s_1$ and $s_2$ are already adopted, $W(s_3)$ can be calculated using the formula.
  - The possible sequences are $(s_1 \rightarrow s_2 \rightarrow s_3), (s_1 \rightarrow s_3 \rightarrow s_2), \ldots$ and so on.

For stories of length $n$, you will have $n!$ possible adoption sequences, each with its own probability based on the $W(s_i)$ values at each step.

### Obtaining the Probability Distribution:

1. **Enumerate all Sequences**: For short stories, you could enumerate all $n!$ sequences and calculate the $W(s_i)$ for each step in each sequence, thereby obtaining the sequence probabilities.

2. **Analyze the Distributions**: Once you've obtained these probabilities for a number of different sequences and story lengths, you may notice patterns or trends that you could potentially formalize into an analytical expression.

3. **Consider Cumulative Probabilities**: To find the shape of the distribution, think about the cumulative probabilities. That is, the probability that a story will be adopted in $t$ or fewer steps.

4. **Series Expansion**: Given the complexity, it could indeed require a series expansion to represent this analytically, especially if you're looking for a general formula as $|S| \rightarrow \infty$.

To get an analytical result, you'd likely need to resort to some simplifications or approximations. One approach could involve solving a recursive formulation of the problem. Another approach might be to use generating functions or a Markov Chain formulation, especially if you're looking to take the limit $|S| \rightarrow \infty$.

Calculating this manually for large $|S|$ would be computationally expensive, so finding an analytical solution, even if approximate, would be valuable. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these approaches?

<h1 style="color:blue">Josh</h1> 

Well - I have two thoughts here; or rather, one thought and one question.  Above, you suggested I "consider cumulative probabilities" - this seems like a decent idea, but is hard in practice without explicitly converting likelihood to time.  Considering a discrete time simulation, and presuming all elements are available at each step, I have a probability distribution over adopting next candidate elements.  This probability distribution converts to an expected time.  I'm not really sure where to go from there though.

A recursive series expansion seems more plausible here;   once again, any state of adoption (S_t) gives us a probability distribution over future adoptions.   My struggle here is in how to "sum" over probability distributions, you know?  When graphing, I simply plot a histogram, but I don't know how to do this mathematically.  Seems like I need an integral somewhere?

<h1 style="color:red">ChatGPT</h1>

Your intuition on both points is quite insightful. Let's dive into each:

### Converting Likelihood to Time

In a discrete time model, your probability distribution \(W(s_i)\) essentially gives you the rate of "jumps" to the next state of adoption, which can be thought of as a sort of mean adoption time. One way to do this would be to model the process as a discrete-time Markov chain where each state corresponds to a specific set \(S_t\). The transition probabilities could be set to \(W(s_i)\), and you can calculate the expected time to reach any particular state using standard Markov chain techniques. The challenge is that the state space grows exponentially with \(|S|\), so this would only be practical for relatively small \(|S|\).

### Recursive Series Expansion and Summing Over Probability Distributions

The recursive approach seems promising, especially because your adoption likelihood \(W(s_i)\) only depends on the current state \(S_t\), not how you got there. This makes it relatively straightforward to apply dynamic programming techniques to compute the total probability of ending up in each possible state, given a starting state.

When you talk about summing over probability distributions, it's worth remembering that you're looking for the probability distribution of the entire sequence of adoptions. The integral you're talking about might be a way to sum (or integrate) over all the possible paths that lead to a given final state, weighted by their probabilities.

If your simulation yields histograms, you're essentially discretizing a continuous space of adoption sequences. Mathematically speaking, you might want to consider convolution operations, which essentially "sum over distributions." In the discrete case, convolutions can be thought of as a form of "sliding dot product" that combine two sequences in a particular way.

For a linear story, convolution could be useful for summing the distributions step-by-step (i.e., at each discrete time step), assuming that the step at each time is independent of the steps at other times given the current state (which is true in your case by design). However, the trick will be to define your base distribution and then figure out how to apply the convolution operator in a way that captures the behavior of your adoption model \(W(s_i)\).

Would you like to explore any of these aspects in more detail?

<h1 style="color:blue">Josh</h1> 

Convolution sounds promising!  Can you tell me more?  Remember, my goal here is to come up with a simple formula that describes the shape of the distribution.

<h1 style="color:red">ChatGPT</h1>

Certainly! Convolution is a mathematical operation that can be thought of as a way to combine two functions to produce a third function. In the context of probability, it can describe the distribution of the sum of two or more independent random variables. If you've ever added two dice together, you've encountered a convolution of two uniform distributions.

For discrete distributions $f$ and $g$, their convolution $(f * g)$ is defined as:

$$(f * g)[n] = \sum_{m} f[m] \times g[n - m]$$

For continuous distributions, it is:

$$(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) \times g(t - \tau) d\tau$$

### Convolution in Your Context

In your context, you have a sequence of adoption steps, each represented by a distribution of "jump rates" or likelihoods. If you could represent the adoption step from $S_t$ to $S_{t+1}$ as a distribution $f_t$, then you would convolve $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{|S|}$ to get the distribution of times to adopt the entire story. 

If your stories are linear, each step's likelihood $W(s_i)$ can be represented as a discrete distribution $f_i$, and you would then take the convolution of all these distributions to obtain the total distribution for the entire sequence.

### Challenges

The challenge, of course, is that the likelihood $W(s_i)$ is not a fixed distribution; it depends on the current set $S_t$ of adopted story items. However, because your stories are linear (s_i connects to s_(i+1)), this dependency structure might be simplified enough to make the convolution tractable.

The basic idea would be to start with some initial $f_1$ representing $W(s_1)$ (which is a constant since $S_t = \emptyset$ initially), then calculate $f_2$ based on that, then $f_3$, and so on. Because your $W(s_i)$ function uses the shortest path $d(s_i, s_j)$ in its calculation, and because the story is linear, each $f_i$ should be calculable in terms of $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{i-1}$.

### How to Approach

1. **Start Simple**: Begin by calculating $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ for a very short linear story.
  
2. **Convolve**: Take the convolution of these to get the distribution for adopting the entire short story.
  
3. **Analyze**: Look for patterns in how each $f_i$ is calculated.
  
4. **Generalize**: Try to find a formula that will let you calculate $f_i$ in terms of $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_{i-1}$.

5. **Iterate**: Convolve $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ in the general case, looking for simplifications that might yield a closed-form solution.

6. **Check**: Validate your closed-form solution against your histograms to see if it's accurate.

Would you like to dive into any specific part of this approach?

Seems like convolution is indeed a good way to approach things.  See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)
